# Foundry DAO Governance
1. We are going to have a contract controlled by a DAO
2. Every transaction that the DAO wants to send has to be voted on 
3. We will use ERC20 tokens for voting

*Please note: ERC20 based voting is not always recommended, and it is best to explore other forms of governance like reputation based or "skin-in-the-game" based.*
